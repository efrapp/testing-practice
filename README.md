# Testing Practice Project

In this project we are incorporating a new tool to our toolbox, that is, Testing. With it, we can make our applications strong using a tool that checks if our code does what it says it does. An additional benefit of it is that we avoid regressions in our code, meaning that when we introduce changes, the previous code we wrote doesn't break with the new one.

We are using Test-Driven Development as the methodology to orchestrate our tests. For this, we need to follow these steps:
* Create a failed test to the feature we are trying to build (a red test)
* Build the minimum code needed to pass the test (a green test)
* Apply refactoring to the built code

## Concepts Applied
* Test Driven Development

## Tools Used
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) runner

## Usage

- Clone the project and move to the root of it: `git clone -b <branch> <repo_url>`
- Run `npm install` to install all the needed dependencies
- To run the tests, execute the following command: `npm run test`
